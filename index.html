							<h1>The Story of Us</h1>
							<p class="major">Imagine combining the elements of every popular k-drama WITHOUT the love triangles, tragedies, or cliches. Hmm... aren't those what make a K-Drama what they are? Well, our story has all their best parts and so much more. A year filled with love, growth, adventure, mystery, and memories to remember for a lifetime: this is The Story of Us.</p>

							<h2>Early Days</h2>
							<p>When we first started dating, I didn't know what to expect. I only had a little experience and didn't think I would enter a relationship quickly, but everything changed with you. Day by day and date by date, any confusion or doubts about dating faded. Looking back on those early months, I feel stupid for worrying about anything. Today, as I should've been back then, I'm confident in all my choices and wouldn't change anything.</p>

							<h2>Spring</h2>
							<p>There are so many highlights from our spring semester. It's so difficult to choose just a few. We snagged crazy deals at the thrift, looking stylish in the process. We went to the gym and held the title of the most jacked couple in planet fitness (very impressive, I know). We had plenty of great eats, even cooking some of them ourselves (Gordan Ramsey Style). We went to unique locations and started to build our photo time capsule. We made memories with some of my oldest friends. Each week, I couldn't wait to pick you up from the Pratt campus in Manhattan or the Path station in Hoboken and spend the day with you! Each time was a new adventure waiting to be explored. These moments are some of the happiest ones of my life!</p>

							<h2>Summer</h2>
							<p>No school, money coming in from our internships, and a long-date plan checklist meant we had one busy summer ahead of us. I'd grind throughout the week, working two internships and doing LeetCode and job applications. You'd hone your architecture skills at a top NY firm while pursuing a Google UX certificate and eventually land your dream role as UX Designer at a tech company! Despite all these things, we still did so much and maximized every second we could spare together. You met my family and impressed every relative (they probably like you more than me at this point). I met the Pratt squad and made some new friends. We went to our first formal event together at a vineyard and drank wine (some fancy ones, kinda yucky tho...) We had more gym dates, getting crazy gains from our new youtube knowledge and meal prep recipes. These events molded us into the craziest power couple with the best qualities: motivated, time efficient, and successful.</p>

						<h2>Fall / Winter</h2>
						<p>Going into the semester, I knew finding time would be more difficult. Your internship ended, and you were back in school, but I got rehired and continued working both jobs throughout the semester on top of my career search. My calendar was packed with interviews, standup meetings, sprint reviews, networking events, and studying. That meant that there were some weeks we couldn't meet. When we did, we might only have time to watch a movie or talk about our busy days over facetime. Despite all this, you were patient and motivated me the whole time! With your support, I got a successful job offer alongside in-demand skills. I celebrated your minion-themed birthday and had a fun night with the Pratt gang. We both got top marks in our courses and learned about your FAT UX designer paycheck (after which you promptly treated me to a nice meal). After that long semester of grinding, I chose to take off work for a month. This break was the best decision I could've made as, after all my hard work, I could finally kick back and spend time with family, friends, and of course you! We celebrated Christmas, spent weekends with fun activities, and recreated our first date for our anniversary! I can't believe that time went by so quickly, but I'm confident we made the best of every moment.</p>

							<h2>Favorite Moments By Month</h2>
							<p>As skilled a developer as I am, it's impossible to capture our first year together on this site. So here's a collection of some of my favorite moments of each month. Some of these you might disagree with, but these were the ones that stuck out to me and were my favorites!</p>

									<div class="caption">
										<h3>January</h3>
										<p>While not apparent, this photo marked our first time at Mango Mango. You had never had it at the time, so we gave it your first try. Since then, it has become a staple of our diet with how many times we've been there. As silly as it sounds, sometimes its nice to just sit around and eat mangos with you.</p>

										<h3>February</h3>
										<p>Our first valentines day was so special! I decorated the apartment, prepared a special meal, and we had a candle-lit dinner. This day involved a ton of prep and set the standard high for future dates, but I'd do it again any day for you.</p>

									<a href="images/gallery/March.png" class="image">

									</a>
									<div class="caption">
										<h3>March</h3>
										<p>This picture reminds me of how we raided the thrift, snagging our best pieces and improving our style with each run. Even now, we hold the record for always showing up overdressed. Here's to more thrift runs and more overdressing!</p>

									<a href="images/gallery/April.png" class="image">

									<div class="caption">
										<h3>April</h3>
										<p>Ugh, you and your pho addiction... I'm not the biggest fan of pho, but it made me so happy to see you get excited over this dish! Whether in Hoboken, New York, or back at my place in East Brunswick, you've always convinced me to get pho. I couldn't say no to you, but that didn't bother me. I'll get you as many bowls as you want, all on me!</p>

									<a href="images/gallery/May.png" class="image">

										<h3>May</h3>
										<p>This picture was taken after my Hawaii trip during the spring semester. I was so excited about this vacation, but I didn't realize how much I'd miss you. The whole time I was there, I thought about how much I'd love to take you there in the future! Having this picnic by the Hoboken pier was amazing because I finally got to see you again!</p>

										<h3>June</h3>
										<p>At the start of the summer, we spent so much time together. We had pool parties and barbecues, went on plenty of boba runs, fun event dates, and much more! June was an action-packed month, and we got much closer during this time!</p>

										<h3>July</h3>
										<p>I love going for walks and messing around with you. My favorite place for this is Newport Mall. We window-shopped, watched movies, took pictures next to the banners, cracked jokes, and occasionally embarrassed ourselves in public by being too loud. </p>

									<a href="images/gallery/August.png" class="image">

									<div class="caption">
										<h3>August</h3>
										<p>The easy highlight for this month was our mini-golfing date! The scene was beautiful, the activity was fun, and it was my favorite date over the entire summer! While I'm no tiger woods, I'd always finish the holes before you. But I'd have the options to help you finish up, give you some extra points, or try to mess up your shots. We got some dirty looks for taking long at each hole, but screw them. They didn't know how to have fun.</p>

									<div class="caption">
										<h3>September</h3>
										<p>This sandwich is the diet-disrupting culprit, the infamous banh mi... We went to the Bon Banh restaurant for three weeks to get these, and it's still one of our favorite foods. Somehow, they would always call us to cheat on our diets, but we managed to justify eating one after a gym session.</p>

									<a href="images/gallery/October.png" class="image">

									</a>
									<div class="caption">
										<h3>October</h3>
										<p>Gym rat! Gym rat! Gym rat! Going to the gym and helping each other improve has become a core of our relationship. While we both enjoy training on our own and doing our routines, we still like to visit each other during rest and pose together after a good pump.</p>

								<article>
									<a href="images/gallery/November.png" class="image">
										<img src="images/gallery/November.png" alt="" />
									</a>
									<div class="caption">
										<h3>November</h3>
										<p>Your first birthday with me! I got to meet more of your friends, we celebrated multiple times, and not going to lie, I got you some banger gifts. This day has become a holiday for me, and I'll celebrate it every year with you!</p>
									</div>
								</article>
								<article>
									<a href="images/gallery/December.png" class="image">
										<img src="images/gallery/December.png" alt="" />
									</a>
									<div class="caption">
										<h3>December</h3>
										<p>It was around this month in the prior year that we started texting. This was an incredibly nostalgic month, and I couldn't believe how far we've come. It made me so happy to do cliche Christmas activities with you and explore all the decorations in New York. I didn't know what I wanted for Christmas because I already had you!</p>
